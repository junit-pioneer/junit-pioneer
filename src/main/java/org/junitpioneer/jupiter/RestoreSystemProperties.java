/**
 * {@code @RestoreSystemProperties} is a JUnit Jupiter extension to restore the entire set of
 * system properties to the original value, or the value of the higher-level container, after the
 * annotated element is complete.
 *
 * <p>Use this annotation when there is a need programmatically modify system properties in a test
 * method or in {@code @BeforeAll} / {@code @BeforeEach} blocks.
 * To simply set or clear a system property, consider {@link SetSystemProperty @SetSystemProperty} or
 * {@link ClearSystemProperty @ClearSystemProperty} instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code RestoreSystemProperties} can be used on the method and on the class level.
 * When placed on a test method, a snapshot of system properties is stored prior to that test.
 * The snapshot is created before any {@code @BeforeEach} blocks in scope and before any
 * {@link SetSystemProperty @SetSystemProperty} or {@link ClearSystemProperty @ClearSystemProperty}
 * annotations on that method. After the test, system properties are restored from the
 * snapshot after any {@code @AfterEach} have completed.
 *
 * <p>When placed on a test class, a snapshot of system properties is stored prior to any
 * {@code @BeforeAll} blocks in scope and before any {@link SetSystemProperty @SetSystemProperty}
 * or {@link ClearSystemProperty @ClearSystemProperty} annotations on that class.
 * After the test class completes, system properties are restored from the snapshot after any
 * {@code @AfterAll} blocks have completed.
 * In addition, a class level annotation is inherited by each test method just as if each one was
 * annotated with {@code RestoreSystemProperties}.
 *
 * <p>During
 * <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution" target="_top">parallel test execution</a>,
 * all tests annotated with {@link RestoreSystemProperties}, {@link SetSystemProperty},
 * {@link ReadsSystemProperty}, and {@link WritesSystemProperty}
 * are scheduled in a way that guarantees correctness under mutation of shared global state.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more details and examples, see
 * <a href="https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/system-properties/" target="_top">the documentation on
 * <code>@ClearSystemProperty</code>, <code>@SetSystemProperty</code>, and <code>@RestoreSystemProperties</code></a>.</p>
 *
 * <p><em>Note:</em> System properties are normally just a hashmap of strings, however, it is
 * technically possible to store non-string values and create nested {@code Properties} with inherited /
 * default values. Within the context of an element annotated with {@link RestoreSystemProperties},
 * non-String values are not preserved and the structure of nested defaults are flattened.
 * After the annotated context is exited, the original Properties object is restored with
 * all its potential (non-standard) richness.</p>
