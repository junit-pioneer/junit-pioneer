/**
 * {@code @FailAt} is a JUnit Jupiter extension to mark tests that shouldn't be executed after a given date,
 * essentially failing a test when the date is reached. The date is given as an ISO 8601 string.
 *
 * <p>It may optionally be declared with a reason to document why the annotated test class or test
 * method should fail at the given date.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code @FailAt} can be used on the method and class level. It can only be used once per method or class,
 * but is inherited from higher-level containers.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This annotation allows the user to move an assumption out of one or multiple test
 * method's code into an annotation. But this comes at a cost: Applying {@code @FailAt} can make the test suite
 * non-reproducible. If a passing test is run again after the specified date, that build would fail. A report entry is
 * issued for every test that does not fail until a certain date.</p>
 *
 * @since 2.3.0
