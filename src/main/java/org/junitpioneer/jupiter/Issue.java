/**
 * {@code @Issue} is a JUnit Jupiter extension to mark tests that
 * exist to cover an issue, like a requirement or a bugfix.
 *
 * The annotated issue ID will be published as a report entry - where
 * this information will be visible, depends on the tool used to
 * execute the tests.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Issue} can be used on the method and class level.
 * Warning: If you place it on class level, make sure to not mix tests which belong to the issue and those which don't!</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code @Issue} can only be used once per method.
 * This is done on purpose because a test case should only cover exactly
 * one aspect of a method.</p>
