A melting pot for all kinds of extensions to
[JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5), particular to its Jupiter API.

Check out [junit-pioneer.org](https://junit-pioneer.org/), particularly [the documentation section](https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/).


## A Pioneer's Mission

JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for [JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) and its Jupiter API.
It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experimentation.
It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

To enable easy exchange of code with JUnit 5, JUnit Pioneer copies most of its infrastructure, from code style to build tool and configuration to continuous integration.


## Getting on Board

JUnit Pioneer is released on [GitHub](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/releases) and [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer). Coordinates:

* group ID: `org.junit-pioneer`
* artifact ID: `junit-pioneer`
* version: [![Latest Junit Pioneer on Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer)

For Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.junit-pioneer</groupId>
	<artifactId>junit-pioneer</artifactId>
	<version><!--...--></version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```groovy
testCompile group: 'org.junit-pioneer', name: 'junit-pioneer', version: /*...*/
```


## Dependencies

Starting with release 2.0, JUnit Pioneer is compiled against **Java 11** and comes as a module (i.e. with a `module-info.class`) named _org.junitpioneer_.
That means it can be used on all Java versions 11 and higher on class path and module path.

Pioneer does not only use JUnit 5's API, but also other artifacts from its ecosystem such as [`junit-platform-commons`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-commons).
To avoid dependency issues (e.g. in [junit-pioneer#343](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/343)), you should add the JUnit 5 BOM ([`junit-bom`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit/junit-bom)) to your project instead of defining all dependency versions manually.

To not add to user's [JAR hell](https://nipafx.dev/jar-hell/), JUnit Pioneer is not taking on any runtime dependencies besides JUnit 5.
Pioneer always depends on the lowest JUnit 5 version that supports its feature set, but that should not keep you from using 5's latest and greatest.

Since 1.7.0 we also have an **optional** runtime dependency on [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), for our JSON-based extensions.
You can read a bit more about our approach to dependencies in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#others).

For our own infrastructure, we rely on the following compile and test dependencies:

* AssertJ (assertions for our tests)
* Mockito (mocking for our tests)
* Log4J (to configure logging during test runs)
* Jimfs (as an in-memory file system for our test)
* Equalsverifier (for easier assertion of simple things)


## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all shapes and forms! üåû

= Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Pledge
-----------

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards
--------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Enforcement Responsibilities
-----------------------------

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (this includes but is not limited to the project's presence on GitHub and the nipafx Discord server), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Stark violations outside of immediate community spaces (for example on Twitter, even if not directed at community members) are also in scope of this Code of Conduct.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to Nicolai Parlog (contact options) or the other maintainers (via Discord DMs). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated fairly and as promptly as circumstances allow (as explained in the contribution guide, there's no expectation of availability towards maintainers).

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Enforcement Guidelines
----------------------

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction

	Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

	Consequence: A private (if possible), written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. Warning

	Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

	Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. Temporary Ban

	Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

	Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. Permanent Ban

	Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

	Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
