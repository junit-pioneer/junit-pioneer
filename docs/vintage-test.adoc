:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with a drop-in replacement for JUnit 4's @Test annotation, including expected and timeout

The annotation `org.junitpioneer.vintage.@Test` is a drop-in replacement for https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/Test.html[JUnit 4's `org.junit.@Test` annotation], but marks the method as a regular JUnit Jupiter test.

You can make use of it when migrating tests from JUnit 4 to Jupiter by doing a fulltext search/replace of `import org.junit.Test` with `import org.junitpioneer.vintage.Test`.
That means you do not need to run JUnit 5's Vintage engine to execute such tests--Jupiter suffices.

This should be seen as an intermediate step towards a full migration and should be followed up by gradual/manual replacement of of `org.junitpioneer.vintage.Test` with Jupiter's `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`.
To emphasize its character as a temporary solution and to reduce https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/137[risk of accidental use], it's marked as deprecated.

Since the test is run by Jupiter, *JUnit 4 runners and rules will have no effect* and you will still have to replace them with JUnit 5 extensions.

Like JUnit 4's version, `@Test` has two optional parameters:

* `expected` to fail a test unless an exception of the specified type is thrown
* `timeout` to fail and abandon a test that runs too long

== Expecting exceptions

The optional parameter `expected` declares that a test method should throw an exception.
If it doesn't throw an exception or if it throws an exception whose type is not the specified one and does not extend it, the test fails.

For example, the following test succeeds because the thrown exception is of the specified type:

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)
public void outOfBounds_passes() {
	new ArrayList<Object>().get(1);
}
----

This test succeeds because the thrown exception is a subtype of the specified one:

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=RuntimeException.class)
public void outOfBounds_passes() {
	new ArrayList<Object>().get(1);
}
----

Finally, this test fails because the thrown exception is neither of the specified type nor a subtype:

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void outOfBounds_fails() {
	new ArrayList<Object>().get(1);
}
----

== Fail long-running tests

The optional parameter `timeout` causes a test to fail if it takes longer than a specified amount of clock time, measured in milliseconds.
The following test fails:

[source,java]
----
@Test(timeout=100)
public void slow_fail() {
	Thread.sleep(1_000);
}
----

Like in JUnit 4, `timeout` aborts long-running tests.
The following tests does not run indefinitely--it failes after 100 milliseconds:

[source,java]
----
@Test(timeout=100)
public void indefinitely() {
	while(true);
}
----

== Thread-Safety

This extension is safe to use during https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel test execution].
