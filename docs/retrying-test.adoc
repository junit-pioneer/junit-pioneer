:page-title: Retrying Failing Tests
:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@RetryingTest`, which retries a failing test a certain number of times; only marking it failed if none of them pass
:xp-demo-dir: ../src/demo/java
:demo: {xp-demo-dir}/org/junitpioneer/jupiter/RetryingTestExtensionDemo.java

Some tests, e.g. those depending on external systems, may fail through no fault of the code under test.
Such tests make a suite fragile and it makes sense to try and avoid them, but if that's infeasible, it may help to retry a number of times before eventually assuming actual failure.
`RetryingTest` provides that functionality.

== Attributes

=== maxAttempts (alias: value) [required]

The `maxAttempts` attribute specifies the maximum number of times to execute the test function.
If the test function throws an exception, the test will be executed again, up to this limit.

The `value` attribute is an alias for `maxAttempts`.
The attribute can be set either with `@RetryingTest(N)` or `@RetryingTest(maxAttempts=N)`.

This attribute is required and must be a value greater than `minSuccess`.
Only one of `maxAttempts` or `value` can be set, but not both.

=== minSuccess [optional]

The `minSuccess` attribute specifies the number of times the test function must complete successfully (i.e. without throwing an exception).
The test function will be executed, up to `maxAttempts`, until it completes successfully this number of times.

The default for `minSuccess` is 1. The value must be greater than or equal to 1.

=== onExceptions [optional]

By default, a test annotated with `@RetryingTest` will be retried on all exceptions except https://ota4j-team.github.io/opentest4j/docs/current/api/org/opentest4j/TestAbortedException.html[`TestAbortedException`] (which will abort the test entirely).
To only retry on specific exceptions, use `onExceptions`.

=== name [optional]

The `name` attribute specifies the display name for the individual test invocations.
(To give a custom name to your container, use `@DisplayName` on the test method.)
The attribute value supports these variables:

* `{index}`: will get replaced by the current invocation index
* `{displayName}`: will get replaced by the test container display name

The default for `name` is `[{index}]`.

== Basic Use

`@RetryingTest(n)` is used _instead_ of `@Test` or other such annotations (e.g. `@RepeatedTest`).
The attribute `n` specifies how often the test is executed before giving up.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=retrying_failsNever]
----

The test `failsNever` is executed once (which succeeds) and marked as passed.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=retrying_fails_on_first_but_passes_on_second]
----

The test `failsOnlyOnFirstInvocation` is executed once (which fails) and then once more (which succeeds).
To allow the entire test suite to pass, the first execution is marked as ignored/aborted, which includes the underlying exception - the second is of course marked as passing.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=retrying_fails_always]
----

The test `failsAlways` is executed three times (all of which fail).
The first two executions are marked as ignored/aborted, while the last as failed - each contains the underlying exception.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=retrying_aborted]
----

If a test is aborted (e.g.: because of a failed assumption) `@RetryingTest` won't try again after that.
The test `aborted` is aborted before (or during) its first execution.
The first execution is marked as aborted/skipped, containing the underlying cause.
The test suite as a whole is also marked as aborted/skipped.

=== Configuring the Number of Successes

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=retrying_configure_numbers_of_success]
----

The test `requiresTwoSuccesses` must run at least two times without raising an exception.
However, it will not run more than four times.

=== Configuring on which Exceptions to Retry

Use `onExceptions` to only retry on the mentioned exception(s):

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=retrying_configure_exception_for_retry]
----

This example test method will be executed twice.
The first run yields an `IllegalArgumentException`, which is mentioned in `onExceptions`, so it is marked as aborted and a second run is launched.
(This behavior would be the same without `onExceptions` because then the test is always retried.)
The second run results in a `NullPointerException`, which was _not_ expected and so it is marked as failed and no third run is attempted.
(This behavior is different from a test without `onExceptions`, which would try a third time.)

== Combining `@RetryingTest` with `@Test` et al

If `@RetryingTest` is combined with `@Test` or `TestTemplate`-based mechanisms (like `@RepeatedTest` or `@ParameterizedTest`), the test engine will execute it according to each annotation (i.e. more than once).
This is most likely unwanted and thus the engine warns:

> Possible configuration error:
> method [...] resulted in multiple TestDescriptors [...].
> This is typically the result of annotating a method with multiple competing annotations such as @Test, @RepeatedTest, @ParameterizedTest, @TestFactory, etc.

== Thread-Safety

This extension is thread-safe.
During https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel test execution], all repetitions of a `@RepeatFailedTest` are executed sequentially.
