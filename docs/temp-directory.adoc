:page-title: Temporary Files and Directories (removed in 1.0)
:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@TempDir`, which create and clean up a temporary directory.

NOTE: Since JUnit Jupiter 5.4, there's a https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory[built-in `@TempDir` extension].
It doesn't support custom file systems, but other than that it's much better than this version, so *we removed the extension in JUnit Pioneer 1.0*.
We plan to tackle this problem again in the future - see https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/348[issue #348].

The `TempDirectory` extension can be used to create and clean up a temporary directory for an individual test or all tests in a test class.
To use it, simply register the extension and add a parameter of type `java.nio.file.Path` to your test or lifecycle method or constructor.

For example, the following test registers the extension for a single test method, creates and writes a file to the temporary directory and checks its content.

[source,java]
----
@Test
@ExtendWith(TempDirectory.class)
void test(@TempDir Path tempDir) {
	Path file = tempDir.resolve("test.txt");
	writeFile(file);
	assertExpectedFileContent(file);
}
----

In addition to the default file system, the extension can be used with any `FileSystem` implementation, e.g. https://github.com/google/jimfs[Jimfs].
In order to use a custom file system, simply register the extension programmatically and pass a provider of a custom parent directory of type `Path`.
The following example uses the Jimfs `FileSystem` and passes a custom `tmp` parent directory to the static factory method `TempDirectory::createInCustomDirectory`.

[source,java]
----
class MyTests {

	private static FileSystem fileSystem;

	@BeforeAll
	static void createFileSystem() {
		fileSystem = Jimfs.newFileSystem();
	}

	@AfterAll
	static void closeFileSystem() throws Exception {
		fileSystem.close();
	}

	@RegisterExtension
	Extension tempDirectory = TempDirectory.createInCustomDirectory(() ->
		Files.createDirectories(fileSystem.getPath("tmp")));

	@Test
	void test(@TempDir Path tempDir) {
		Path file = tempDir.resolve("test.txt");
		writeFile(file);
		assertExpectedFileContent(file);
	}

}
----

== Thread-Safety

This extension's thread-safety is undetermined, we recommend to be cautious when using it during https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel test execution].
(We're working on it.)
