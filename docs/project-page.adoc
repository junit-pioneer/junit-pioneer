JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for JUnit 5 and its Jupiter API.
It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments.

JUnit Pioneer is an https://nipafx.dev/junit-5-extension-model/[extension pack] for https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit 5] or, https://nipafx.dev/junit-5-architecture-jupiter/[to be more precise], for the Jupiter engine.
