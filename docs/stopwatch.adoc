== Introduction

Test shall be fast.
To get a feeling how fast or slow a specific test is, the `@Stopwatch` annotation can be used.
It will measure elapsed time and pass the result to the `https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestReporter.html[TestReporter]`, which will publish it.

== Usage

To measure elapsed time just add the `@Stopwatch` annotation to a class or, like in the following example, to a method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=stopwatch_demo]
