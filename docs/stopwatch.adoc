:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@Stopwatch` to measure elapsed time of a test method

== Introduction

Test shall be fast.
To get a feeling how fast or slow a specific test is, the `@Stopwatch` annotation can be used.
It will measure elapsed time and pass the result to the `https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestReporter.html[TestReporter]`, which will publish it.

== Usage

To measure elapsed time just add the `@Stopwatch` annotation to a class or, like in the following example, to a method:

[source,java]
----
@Stopwatch
@Test
void test() {
	// Some test
}
----
