:page-title: Range Sources
:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@IntRangeSource`, `@FloatRangeSource`, etc., which provide series of numbers as argument sources for parameterized tests.

The various range sources can be used to provide a series of numeric arguments with fixed differences between them (i.e., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression[arithmetic progressions]) to a `@ParameterizedTest`.
There is a range source for every corresponding numeric primitive type: `ByteRangeSource`, `ShortRangeSource`, `IntRangeSource`, `LongRangeSource`, `FloatRangeSource`, and `DoubleRangeSource`.

== Basic Use

In the basic use case, using any range source with just the `from` and `to` parameters will provide a series of numeric arguments with a difference of 1 between them, beginning at `from` ending at the last value smaller than `to` (i.e. _excluding_ `to`).

[source,java]
----
@ParameterizedTest
@IntRangeSource(from = 0, to = 10)
// called 10 times with `digit` = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
void validDigit(int digit) {
	System.out.println(digit + " is a valid digit");
}
----

== Defining the step

The `step` argument allows controlling the difference between the consecutive values.
It can be positive or negative:

[source,java]
----
@ParameterizedTest
@DoubleRangeSource(from = -0.1, to = -10, step = -0.1)
void howColdIsIt(double d) {
	System.out.println(d + " °C is cold");
	System.out.println(d + " °F is REALY cold");
	System.out.println(d + " K is too cold to be true");
}
----

== Open and closed range sources

By default, range sources represent ranges that are inclusive of the starting point (the `from` value), and exclusive of the end point (the `to` value).
This behavior can be controlled by specifying the `closed` argument:

[source,java]
----
@ParameterizedTest
@ByteRangeSource(from = 0, to = 0)
void illegalRange(byte arg) {
	// this will fail with an IllegalArgumentException
	// since the range will be empty
}

@ParameterizedTest
@LongRangeSource(from = 0L, to = 0L, closed = true)
void legalRrange(long arg) {
	// But this is fine
	assertThat(arg).isEqualTo(0L);
}
----

== Empty ranges

The range sources check whether the range defined by `from`, `to`, and `step` is empty and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is.

== Thread-Safety

This extension is safe to use during https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel test execution].
