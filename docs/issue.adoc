:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@Issue` to publish issue information.

== Introduction

The main reason developers write tests is to ensure the functionality of a requirement or to avoid technical problems.
The `@Issue` annotation allows marking tests with a `String`, referencing a related issue (like a requirement, or a bugfix) of an issue-tracker (like Jira or Redmine).

It's a JUnit Jupiter extension for showing that tests exist to cover a specific issue.

== Usage

The extension is divided into two parts:
First there is an annotation to mark that a test belongs to a specific issue.

The second part of the extension deals with publishing these results.
The specified issue ID will always be published as a report entry - where this information will be visible, depends on the tool used to execute the tests.
Then there is an API interface to further process the results, so users can plug in their own behavior, e.g. generating a report, sending mails, or marking the CI-build as failed.

=== Annotating a test

To show that a test relates to an issue just add the annotation and provide a value, e.g. a Jira issue id, like in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Issue("REQ-123")
@Test
void test() {
	// One of the tests for the issue with the id "REQ-123"
}
----

The `@Issue` annotation can be used on the class and method level.

WARNING: If you place it on class level, make sure to not mix tests which belong to the issue and those which don't!

The `@Issue` annotation can only be used once per class or method.
This is done on purpose, because a test case should only cover exactly one aspect of a method.

=== `IssueProcessor` API

Pioneer tracks the results of tests which are annotated with the `@Issue` annotation, using an https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#launcher-api-listeners-custom[ExecutionListener].
After all tests are executed, their unique names, results, and the annotated value (called `issueID`) are provided through the `IssueProcessor` API.

To use the information published this way, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[a service implementation] of the `IssueProcessor` interface must be provided by the user.

The following snippet shows a simple implementation of the interface that just prints out the `issueID` of received values:

[source,java]
----
public class SimpleProcessor implements IssueProcessor {

	@Override
	public void processTestResults(
			List<IssueTestSuite> allResults) {
		for(IssueTestSuite testSuite : allResults) {
			System.out.println(testSuite.issueId());
		}
	}

}
----

NOTE: The implementing class must be registered to the Java ecosystem as a service.
For further information about registering a service, please see the Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[`ServiceLoader` documentation].
