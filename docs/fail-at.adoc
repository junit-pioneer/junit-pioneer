:page-title: Fail test after certain date
:page-description: The JUnit 5 (Jupiter) extension `@FailAt` fails a test after a certain date
:xp-demo-dir: ../src/demo/java
:demo: {xp-demo-dir}/org/junitpioneer/jupiter/FailAtExtensionDemo.java

It's sometimes useful to fail a test after a certain date.
One can imagine many reasons for doing so, maybe a remote dependency of the test is not licenced anymore.

The `@FailAt` annotation is perfectly suited for such cases.
The test will fail when the given date is reached.

[WARNING]
====
This annotation allows the user to move an https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-assumptions[assumption] out of one or multiple test method's code into the annotation.
But this comes at a cost:
Applying `@FailAt` can make the test suite non-reproducible.
If a passing test is run again after the specified date, that build would fail.
A report entry is issued for every test that does not fail until a certain date.
====

== Usage

To mark a test to fail at a given date, add the `@FailAt` annotation like so:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=fail_at_simple]
----

The `date` parameter must be a string in the date format specified by https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601], e.g. "1985-10-26".
Invalid or unparsable date strings lead to an `ExtensionConfigurationException`.

The `@FailAt` annotation may optionally be declared with a reason to document why the annotated test class or test method fails as soon as the date is reached:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=fail_at_with_reason]
----

The `@FailAt` annotation can be used on the class and method level, it will be inherited from higher-level containers:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{demo}[tag=fail_at_at_class_level]
----

The `@FailAt` annotation can only be used once per class or method.

== Before and After

The test will be executed normally if the date specified by `date` is in the future, but a warning entry will be published to the https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/report-entries[test report] to indicate that there might be a problem in the future.

If `date` is today or in the past, the test will fail as the execution condition is not fulfilled anymore.

== Thread-Safety

This extension is safe to use during https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel test execution].
