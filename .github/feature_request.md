**Please give information what category your feature request is about**

Examples:
- An extension
- The build or infrastructure (IDE, Github, Gradle)
- The documentation
- Something different

**Please describe the cause of your feature request? What do you try to do and realize that a tool / functionality is missing?**

For example:
- I tried to use extension Y to do X, but with the current implementation I can only do Z
- I read about this fancy thing, Gradle can do now!

**Please describe, what you would like to be changed / added / improved. If you want to add code or pseudo-code snippets, feel free to do so. If you have knowledge about possible side effects or problems or have considered any alternative solutions, please add information about them, too**

Example:
- I would like to see the possibility to use a new annotation, maybe `@Fancy("value")` to do X
- I suggest to update to Java 2042 to use the new feature Z, but this also means, that the Gradle version has to be updated, and it's only a release candidate (RC) so far
