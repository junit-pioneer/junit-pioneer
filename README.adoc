A melting pot for all kinds of extensions to
https://github.com/junit-team/junit5[JUnit 5], particular to its Jupiter API.

Check out https://junit-pioneer.org/[junit-pioneer.org], particularly https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/[the documentation section].

== A Pioneer's Mission

JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/[JUnit 5] and its Jupiter API.
It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experimentation.
It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

To enable easy exchange of code with JUnit 5, JUnit Pioneer copies most of its infrastructure, from code style to build tool and configuration to continuous integration.


== Getting on Board

JUnit Pioneer is released on https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/releases[GitHub] and https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer[Maven Central]. Coordinates:

* group ID: `org.junit-pioneer`
* artifact ID: `junit-pioneer`
* version: `...`

For Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.junit-pioneer</groupId>
	<artifactId>junit-pioneer</artifactId>
	<version><!--...--></version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

For Gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
testCompile group: 'org.junit-pioneer', name: 'junit-pioneer', version: /*...*/

[#dependencies]
== Dependencies

Starting with release 2.0, JUnit Pioneer is compiled against **Java 11** and comes as a module (i.e. with a `module-info.class`) named _org.junitpioneer_.
That means it can be used on all Java versions 11 and higher on class path and module path.

Pioneer does not only use JUnit 5's API, but also other artifacts from its ecosystem such as https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-commons[`junit-platform-commons`].
To avoid dependency issues (e.g. in https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/343[junit-pioneer#343]), you should add the JUnit 5 BOM (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit/junit-bom[`junit-bom`]) to your project instead of defining all dependency versions manually.

To not add to user's https://nipafx.dev/jar-hell/[JAR hell], JUnit Pioneer is not taking on any runtime dependencies besides JUnit 5.
Pioneer always depends on the lowest JUnit 5 version that supports its feature set, but that should not keep you from using 5's latest and greatest.

Since 1.7.0 we also have an **optional** runtime dependency on https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson], for our JSON-based extensions.
You can read a bit more about our approach to dependencies in the link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc#others[contribution guide].

For our own infrastructure, we rely on the following compile and test dependencies:

* AssertJ (assertions for our tests)
* Mockito (mocking for our tests)
* Log4J (to configure logging during test runs)
* Jimfs (as an in-memory file system for our test)
* Equalsverifier (for easier assertion of simple things)
